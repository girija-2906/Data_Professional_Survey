# Data_Professional_Survey
I developed a comprehensive project in Power BI by creating multiple Visuals to analyze the data. This process involved several stages including data preprocessing,  data cleaning and data visualization.
## Project Objective
The objective of a Data Professional survey breakdown to analyze and interpret survey data collected from individuals working in data related fields. 
This project aims to gain actionable insights, identify trends, and support strategic decision-making for organizations or stakeholders interested in the data science and analytics domain.
## Dataset Used
